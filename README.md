# PROG 01: Crunch Time

Crunch Time is a mobile Anroid app that allows user to calculate the number of calories a 150-lb person would burn from various exercises.  Enter the type of exercise and number of reps/minutes to figure out how many calories you would burn. You can also view the number of reps/minutes for which you would need to perform different exercises to burn the same number of calories.
